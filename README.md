This is simple application to dynamically display the weather that use [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api), [Yandex maps](https://yandex.ru/maps-api/products) and [Unplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers)
Also i used [Api Ninja](https://api-ninjas.com/api/airports) to get IATA codes of airports and [FlightAPI](https://api.flightapi.io/) to find the information about air filghts.
